Paths forward:
Continue walking
Replace gRPC or MongoDB or .Net or Flutter
Restart
Possibly months of no progress
Better get it right!


Handle migration of all customers by Sep 1

 Steps involved in restarting:
Learn a new framework
Research best practices, document them

Current cost of hosting and servers: 1500 - 2000 USD

Goals of an ideal tech stack:

 Database goals:
 Generally speaking, we should embrace the NoSql paradigm if we use a NoSql database or vice versa.
 Following are some refactors needed to do that:
    - real time updates for any object or list of objects
    - all assets should be retrieved in a single databse query
        (right now it takes 3 seperate db queries to fetch vehicles, containers and depots)

 FE options:
  - Flutter, Vue, React
  - Flutter:
    - Dart makes Osama's heart flutter.
    - existing codebase that can be reused to a great degree
    - tableBuilder and modal builder have been refined over months
    - the FormBuilder thingy being worked on currently has great potential also
    - Nathan also has experience with Flutter
    - Flutter works well with Firebase

    - Flutter autofill is still an issue
    - Flutter developers might not be easy to hire for
    - Ai is not great at Flutter

  - Vue:
    - easier to outsource development
    - Ai good

    - learn Vue, establish best practices.
    - find the correct packages for routing, state management etc

  - React:
    - better tooling and community
    - Ai good

    - learn react, establish best practices.
    - find the correct packages for routing, state management etc

 BE options:
  - firebase, dotNet, node
  - firebase:
    - very fast to develop with (Baas)
    - real time updates

  - dotNet:
   - existing codebase
   - Nathan has experience with dotNet
   - easy to hire for

   - working with dotNet on VSCode is a real pain


 Database options:
  - NoSql
    - firestore, MongoDB, Supabase,
    - MongoDB:
        - Nathan has experience with it
        - no real time updates so far (possible in the future)
        - but we should start using it like a NoSql database
    - firestore:
        - osama has experience with it
        - real time updates for free


  - Sql
    - MySQL, Postgres, MicrosoftSQL



Estimates for a full rebuild:
 - Kevin (tech stack of his choice):
    - React, Node, Next, Postgres, OpenApi, Tailwind
    - 6 month all out project
         (with tasks and polymorphoic products implented only in data models, but ui and user abilities do not change)

 - Osama (tech stack of his choice)
    - Flutter, Firebae
